# Hi there, I'm AYU2027 👋

I am a software engineering student graduating in July 2027, specializing in backend infrastructure, data structures, and protocol engineering. I am deeply passionate about building efficient systems and contributing to the open-source community.

### 🚀 Current Focus
* **Open Source:** Actively contributing to [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) and preparing for Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
* **Engineering:** Deep-diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with C++ to prepare for a Google Software Engineering Internship.
* **Exploration:** Expanding my architectural knowledge across the MERN stack, Hadoop ecosystems, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### ♟️ Beyond the Code
When I am not deep in official documentation or parsing raw hex bytes, you can find me analyzing board positions. I am an active chess player and rigorously preparing for the Combined Defence Services (CDS) examination.
